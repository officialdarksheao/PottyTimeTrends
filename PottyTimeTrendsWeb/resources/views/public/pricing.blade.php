            <h3>Why we do monthly subscriptions</h3>
            <p>The more parents that use this application, the more the server needs to be upgraded to keep running at lightning speeds. A tiny subscription from everyone who uses it makes an organic growth of the server possible, so you never compromise quality and speed when we get popular!</p>

            <h3>Pricing Promise</h3>
            <p>Once signed up, we will <strong>never</strong> increase your subscription fee, no matter what. If our prices need to change and grow, this will only affect new sign ups.</p>
